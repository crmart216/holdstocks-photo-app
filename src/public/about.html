      <p>
      Hey! I'm Ryan Holdstock, a Computer Science student with a passion for photography. I usually just take pictures with my phone (sadly cameras are stupid expensive), but that doesn't stop me! I'm always looking for ways to improve my photography within my means, whether that's finding new editing styles or just learning more about what makes a good photo good! I'm currently studying abroad in Japan. I'd been wanting to put something like this together for a long time: just a place to store my favorite pictures outside of Instagram, and as I'm currently taking a photography course, I felt like the right time was now (and they let me use a real camera!!). I haven't touched CSS or HTML in years, so this was a fun project to throw together to refamiliarize myself.
